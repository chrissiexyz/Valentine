## Valentine Aminated Message webpage

The project uses JavaScript to animate a name and the codes were adopted from a course from Codecademy [Animate your name](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/animate-your-name/0/1).  

The repository include the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of JS resources needed to render the animation, including main.js.
* **js/alphabet.js**: Contains code for formating the alphabet.
* **js/bubbles.js**: Contains function drawName(), bounceName(), bounceBubbles() and variable "bubbleShape" for animating the bubbles effect. 
* **js/main.js**: This is the code you need to modify to control what name/message you want to animate, what colors of your choices and what shape or bouncing effect you would like it to display.
* **js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js**: The jQuery library.
* **README.md**: The GitHub readme file.

## If you want to make changes...

In **js/main.js** file, you can define 
1. variable of the name/message you want to animate, as in var message;
2. variable for colors as the array letterColors, you can uncomment the color vector to make your own combination.
3. control the shape of bubble by setting either bubbleShape = "square" or bubbleShape = "circle", personally I think circle shape is cuter. 
4. control the animation effect to be bounce the name or bounce the bubbles.
5. More advanced changes are to make change in the **js/bubbles.js** file.
